Inspiration is what gets you up in the morning. It’s that feeling where you
can’t wait to pound out those `.apply`’s and write that chrome extension you’ve
been meaning to finish. What gets you through the day?

Recently after finishing a major in Computer Science, I’ve been thinking a lot
about how I should spend my time, and why I do what I do (that being mainly web
development these days). Although I finished my major fall semester, I still had
one last class before graduating, so I decided to try to work throughout the
semester instead of taking it easy. Though my friends may argue that my sitting
around in sweats crushing some carefully crafted CoffeeScript and getting to
work with some truly incredible people may be a walk in the park compared to
their once-every-other-week problem sets, it was different than anything I’ve
ever experienced. There were no rules, everyone was watching your every
semicolon (but not really because CoffeeScript), and more importantly we were
all working together. It might sound strange, but you’ve never felt the pain of
working on a team until you’ve done a `git merge master`, run `git status`, and
seen more red than Freddie Krueger on Elm Street. After a while I got into the
rhythm, writing specs for features and bugs, and throwing together angular
directives with JST templates, and it started making a little more sense.


But why was I doing it? Obviously there’s the axiomatic generalization that it’s
my job, but, I had to ask myself, why did I pick this job? Was it because I was
comfortable with front-end development? Or maybe because I’m not fit for a role
in algorithms development, as it’s been deemed by previous potential employers
(cough all of silicon valley cough). After I thought about it for a bit, all the
while still working and chatting with my co-workers over slack or reviewing PR’s
on GitHub, I came to realize that it’s not the money, it’s not the work, and
it’s not even my wonderful peers– it’s the chance to make a difference, and to
sculpt the [ virtual landscape of our future ](virtual landscape of our
future). It may seem overtly self-centered and egocentric, but I dare say you
have to be.


After all, what else wakes you up more than the satisfaction of the noumenon
and anticipation of what lies in store for tomorrow
