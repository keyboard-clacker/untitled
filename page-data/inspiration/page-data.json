Although I finished my major fall semester, I still had\none last class before graduating, so I decided to try to work throughout the\nsemester instead of taking it easy. Though my friends may argue that my sitting\naround in sweats crushing some carefully crafted CoffeeScript and getting to\nwork with some truly incredible people may be a walk in the park compared to\ntheir once-every-other-week problem sets, it was different than anything I’ve\never experienced. There were no rules, everyone was watching your every\nsemicolon (but not really because CoffeeScript), and more importantly we were\nall working together. It might sound strange, but you’ve never felt the pain of\nworking on a team until you’ve done a <code class=\"language-text\">git merge master</code>, run <code class=\"language-text\">git status</code>, and\nseen more red than Freddie Krueger on Elm Street. After a while I got into the\nrhythm, writing specs for features and bugs, and throwing together angular\ndirectives with JST templates, and it started making a little more sense.</p>\n<p>But why was I doing it? Obviously there’s the axiomatic generalization that it’s\nmy job, but, I had to ask myself, why did I pick this job? Was it because I was\ncomfortable with front-end development? Or maybe because I’m not fit for a role\nin algorithms development, as it’s been deemed by previous potential employers\n(cough all of silicon valley cough). After I thought about it for a bit, all the\nwhile still working and chatting with my co-workers over slack or reviewing PR’s\non GitHub, I came to realize that it’s not the money, it’s not the work, and\nit’s not even my wonderful peers– it’s the chance to make a difference, and to\nsculpt the <a href=\"virtual%20landscape%20of%20our%0Afuture\"> virtual landscape of our future </a>. It may seem overtly self-centered and egocentric, but I dare say you\nhave to be.</p>\n<p>After all, what else wakes you up more than the satisfaction of the noumenon\nand anticipation of what lies in store for tomorrow</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Inspiration","date":"February 28, 2020","description":"What motivates you?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/inspiration/","previous":null,"next":null}}}
